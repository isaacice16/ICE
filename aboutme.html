	<h1>About Me Website</h1>

	<p>Hi, my name is Isaac Jeremy Mercado and I was born on august 16th 2004 in Illinois. Which is suprising because for as
		long as I can remember I've lived in california. I live in indio california and I go to Shadow Hills High School. I love
		competing in sports such as Cross-Country and Basketball. I love school and I love to learn and try my best in all categories
		of school. My favorite color is green, my favorite food is everything, and my favorite hobby is to learn new things. Such
		as, playing the guitar, learning how to sing, learning how to workout, learning basketball moves, learning how to journal,and
		learning different ways to improve my well being. What I like to watch or do on my spare time is watch youtube, play smash
		brothers, or be with friends and family.</p>
